## User Story
```
AS A Web Developer
I WANT to showcase my skills and projects on an organized webpage
SO THAT I will appear employer ready
```

## Business Context
Full Stack Web Developers want to be able to showcase their skills and projects utilizing a coding language that is relevant to the coding community. Creating a portfolio with React.js allows for employers to get a feel for how well the developer can code in that language. Employers will also be able to see if their skillset matches their vision. 

## More About My React Portfolio
I used React.js to upgrade my portfolio and turn my portfolio into a single page application. I explored my front-end development side and made sure to make my portfolio aesthetically pleasing. This project was very fun to work on since I am a big fan of React and I was able to have full creative freedom. Please enjoy :)
