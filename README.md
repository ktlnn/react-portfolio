## More About My React Portfolio
I used React.js to upgrade my portfolio and turn my portfolio into a single page application. I explored my front-end development side and made sure to make my portfolio aesthetically pleasing. This project was very fun to work on since I am a big fan of React and I was able to have full creative freedom. Please enjoy :)
